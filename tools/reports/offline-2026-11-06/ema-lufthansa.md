# Offline package 2026-11-06: ema-lufthansa (Cargo: cargo.css and the Cargo importer; Brussels)

Running report, committed as the work goes. Nothing is published: documents are uploaded to DA and
previewed (da-upload.mjs --site lh-cargo / lh-brussels), checked on the aem.page preview hosts.
Release order for the user: code (on main) first, then files, then the pages that use them.

## 1. Brief 429, Cargo round 3 (done)

What: the bar 60 px up to 1024 px, www's grid at every width, the slide button's outline; story
pictures as www's modules; Facts & Figures' board, compliance and timeline; Support & Contact's
finder over its tabs, its "Contact us" band and technical support; the contact form as a dialog
over Support & Contact; eBooking's columns. Details: tools/reports/cargo/parity.md, "Round 3".

Commits (main): 1a6214c (accordion-columns exclusive, filter as a finder over tabs), a5352fe (a
dialog link's query reaches its form), 03864d1 (importer), 6a9448e (cargo.css), 8e79d0e (report,
state, release list).

Preview paths, in release order (code on main): `/modals/contact-us`, then `/en/support-and-contact`,
`/de/support-and-contact`, then `/en/ci/facts-figures`, `/de/ci/facts-figures`
(tools/importer/cargo-runs/publish-r3.txt).

Checked: main--lh-cargo--moved-permanently.aem.page at 1440 and 390 (and 768, 1024, 1025 for the
bar and grid), cargo.turnsthe.page for the CSS-only changes; smoke cargo and ita before and after
each push: 0 differences.

Open: the key facts' and the timeline's photos, the board members' and compliance pictures, and
Support & Contact's "Contact us" photo are not in lh-cargo's DA (for the harness); inside a Support
& Contact tab the topics stay one under the other (www: a list and the topic's links beside it).

## 2. Cargo's transport stories from cargo-snapshots-003 and -004 (done)

What: both archives from the R2 drop (sha256 checked: 4ff6b392… and 74bac112…), 341 stories (all
German: www's English story URLs come later in the 422 list). Their captures went into
content-sites/lh-cargo/snapshots/ (no capture was there before); cargo-import.mjs (the fixed
importer: www's phone copies left out, the two text columns, the heading order) imported all 341,
its files from what lh-cargo's DA has (--known-from DA's current copies). Each new document against
DA's current copy (read from DA's source API), by passage (every text passage of DA's copy must be
in the new document) and by picture (none of DA's lost; none new from www):

- 263 uploaded and previewed: DA's copies held most passages twice (the phone copy and the desktop
  table, the duplicates fixed in 417), now once. 82 of them have text DA's copy did not (www's
  desktop text where it differs from its phone copy, mostly punctuation, or www's newer text):
  listed with their first new passages in tools/importer/cargo-runs/stories-offline-2026-11-06.tsv.
- 77 unchanged (the new document is DA's): not uploaded.
- 1 held: /de/news/night-shift-in-chicago-44: its photo credit ("Fotos: Cornelia Garmann, Natalia
  Pekhanova") is only in www's phone copy; the import takes the desktop copy, which has no credit
  (www's desktop page does not show it either). DA keeps its copy with the credit.
- 59 pictures (67 places in 65 stories) are only on www (not in lh-cargo's DA): left out of the
  uploaded stories, as their DA copies had none of them; listed for the harness in
  tools/importer/cargo-runs/stories-offline-2026-11-06-files.tsv (cargo-assets.mjs --download,
  then the stories' re-import).
- Not captured (cargo-stories-not-captured.txt, 404): 5 that www answers 404 and 399 the capture
  did not reach before its deadline (09:40 CET); they stay as they are:
  tools/importer/cargo-runs/stories-offline-2026-11-06-not-captured.tsv.

Checked on main--lh-cargo--moved-permanently.aem.page at 1440 and 390, a sample from each upload
batch (10 stories): one H1, the headings in order, no passage twice, no broken picture, no
sideways scroll.

Preview paths (no files: every picture is DA's): the 263 "uploaded and previewed" rows of
tools/importer/cargo-runs/stories-offline-2026-11-06.tsv, in any order (the code is on main).
