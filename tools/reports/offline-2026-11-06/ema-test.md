# ema-test, offline package of 2026-11-06 (Austrian, B2B, Discover)

Running report, committed as I go. Nothing is published: documents are uploaded to DA and previewed
(`da-upload.mjs`), and checked on the aem.page preview hosts. Times in UTC.

## 1. Brief 427 (B2B round 3): done

- `af6a8973` fix(importer): the importers import without the excat plugin. `test/b2b-parity-418.test.mjs`
  failed in the go-live child's clean clone because `b2b-import.mjs` (and four other importers) loaded
  the plugin's `strip-scripts.js`, outside git, when imported. Now `tools/importer/excat-plugin.mjs`
  loads it when it is there; the one test that really strips scripts skips without it. Checked in a
  fresh clone of origin/main with `npm ci`: 350 files pass with the plugin, 351 (one case skipped)
  with `EXCAT_MARKETPLACE` pointing nowhere. `library-entries` passes there too; it fails only in my
  workspace, against my stale untracked `content/library` copy.
- `cf906784` fix(b2b): rows 25-28 of `tools/reports/b2b/parity.md` (www's column-view spacing, the 16:9
  video beside text, the cards' copy, a stage outside a column), B2B-scoped CSS only, no document
  changed. Against b2b-parity-001 (1440 / 390): homepage -236 / -73 -> -19 / +41 px, Product & Service
  News -116 / +213 -> +26 / -4, the article +169 / +207 -> +33 / +71, de/de contact +46 / +473 -> -118 /
  -62.
- Checked: the 26 B2B pages at 1440 and 390 locally and on main--lh-b2b--moved-permanently.aem.page
  (equal); lufthansa.com's stage unchanged; smoke of the 12 hosts before and after each push, 0
  differences; builds green.
- Preview paths: none (no document changed).
- Open (item 3): contact's hotline hours and Corporate -> Passenger Receipts gaps, de/en contact's
  missing column marker, celebrating-shared-stories, the news overview, the airlines page at 390.
